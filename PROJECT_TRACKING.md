## Notes
- Authentication is intentionally scheduled last to facilitate testing
- Each feature should be fully tested before moving to the next
- Regular code reviews are required
- Documentation should be updated with each feature
- Performance metrics should be monitored
- Security best practices should be followed
- Maintain consistent coding standards
- Regular security audits needed
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor system health
- Ensure scalability and maintainability
